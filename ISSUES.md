# Ash Gray fork — issue tracker

Live tracker for the bug-fix fork of Pokémon Ash Gray (beta 4.5.3, by metapod23).
Research sources in `audit/05-known-bugs.md`. Add findings here as we go.

**Severity:** 🔴 critical (crash/softlock/blocks progression) · 🟠 high · 🟡 medium · 🟢 low/cosmetic
**Status:** `open` · `next` (queued) · `wip` · `fixed` · `wontfix` · `needs-repro`
**Fix-where:** `here` (byte/script/data edit) · `map` (event/warp struct edit, headless but more work) · `art` (needs human) · `engine` (battle/system, hard)

## Prioritized — details & fix plans
(Hypotheses to confirm by decompiling the exact script with `tools/decomp.py`.)

### L1 — Indigo Plateau guard (🟠)
*Repro:* all 8 badges + passed entrance exam, guard still says "league hasn't started."
*Hypothesis:* guard's `checkflag` tests a "league open" flag the exam-pass event never `setflag`s (or tests the wrong flag id). Possibly related to **L6** (badge-count miscount feeding a `compare`).
*Plan:* decompile the Indigo gate guard person-script + the exam-pass script → align the flag/`compare`.

### L2 — Prof Oak with a full party (🟠)
*Repro:* full party when the story wants to hand you a Pokémon → nothing happens, event stalls.
*Hypothesis:* script uses `givepokemon` with no full-party fallback; the progression flag is set *after* the give, so a silent give-failure also blocks the flag.
*Plan:* add a party-space / `givepokemon`-result check + "your party is full" message and send-to-box; ensure the progression `setflag` runs regardless.

### L3 — stuck on Misty's bike (🟡)
*Repro:* after Pikachu thundershocks the Spearow, Ash keeps riding the bike.
*Hypothesis:* the bike scene sets an "on bike"/movement-override state that the post-event script forgets to clear.
*Plan:* decompile the Spearow/thundershock aftermath script → `clearflag` / reset player movement state (`special` that restores normal movement).

### F2 — underwater cave black-screen freeze (🔴)
*Repro:* after Dragonite's tournament-invitation message, screen goes black and hangs.
*Hypothesis:* a `special`/warp with no `waitstate`, a `goto` into non-script bytes, or a fade with no fade-in. Classic causes of black-screen hangs.
*Plan:* decompile the Dragonite-message script and the following warp/transition → find the dangling opcode/pointer.

### F3 / F4 — breeding-center & pickaxe-scientist crashes (🟠)
*Hypothesis:* a bad command (corrupt pointer, `applymovement` to a non-existent object, or a `trainerbattle`/`special` with bad args) in those NPC scripts.
*Plan:* decompile each NPC's person-script; compare structure to a working analogue; patch the offending opcode.

### L9 — raft soft-lock from declining Dragonite's invite (🔴)
*Repro:* decline Dragonite's invitation to Mewtwo's island → the raft stops working, Nurse Joy won't let you in, and you can't return to Pallet. Some players report the raft item is "gone."
*Hypothesis:* the **decline** dialogue branch leaves a travel/state flag in a dead state with no recovery path (only the *accept* branch re-enables the raft warp).
*Plan:* decompile the Dragonite-invite script (likely the same map cluster as **F2**) → make the decline branch still leave the raft usable / offer a retry, or auto-set the travel flag.

## By design — NOT bugs (FAQ, so we don't "fix" them)
- **HMs are replaced by key items** — Hatchet = Cut, Raft = Surf, etc. Cut/Surf "not working" is expected.
- **Brock's first battle is a scripted loss** — even if you beat Onix, the story treats it as a loss (anime-accurate).
- **Pikachu refuses to battle Misty** — must use other Pokémon for the Cerulean gym (anime-accurate).
- **Charmander/Charizard disobeys** — its ID is deliberately changed so it disobeys after evolving (anime-accurate).
- **"Stuck, don't know where to go"** — Ash Gray follows the anime; many gates are story-flag based, not bugs.
- **Bad Eggs / freezes from cheats** — using GameShark/all-badges cheats causes much of the instability (see D1).

## Known limitation (not fixable — no content exists)
- **The hack is unfinished**, ending partway through the Orange Islands / Orange League. Reaching the end of
  available content can *look* like a freeze/soft-lock (older betas famously stopped at "the lady after the
  plane crash"). Nothing to fix here unless new content is authored from scratch.
